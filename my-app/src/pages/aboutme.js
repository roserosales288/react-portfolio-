                        <p>I'm a very dedicated individual, I am driven by challenges and often find myself dissatisfied if I am not able to be given an opportunity express my skills. I enjoy an environment that is Agile, and socially developing  constantly. Although I have always had a love for technology and computers I hadn't decided the path that was best for me.I have done technical troubleshooting for about three and a half years. Focused on repairs of computers as I worked with reputable well known companies most recently. I obtained my Masters degree in technology and now I have ventured into the world of coding as I found I am able to use my creative side to help compliment my problem solving capabilities!</p>
